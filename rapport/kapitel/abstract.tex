Haskell is not a widely used programming language, nor very known to the average programmer. By implementing a subset of the Haskell 98 specification in Javascript our intention is to make it  possible to run Haskell in a web browser, thus making it easier for beginners to try Haskell by eliminating the need of downloading Haskell compilers such as the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). 
In this paper we describe the process and result from the project of implementing Haskell in Javascript.

Our result consists of a parser, type checker, interpreter and a front end similar to GHCi.
The parser processes the text input, creating an internal structure called abstract syntax tree (AST). The type checker then analysis the AST to confirm that there are no type errors. If no errors have been detected, the AST is sent to the interpreter. The interpreter then interprets the AST in a well defined way.

The results show that it is possible to successfully implement Haskell in Javascript,  but a lot of more work needs to be done for making a beginner-friendly environment for learning Haskell.
